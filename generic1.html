                            <h3>Lab Experience at College of Automotive Engineering, Jilin university &nbsp &nbsp(July 2022 - December 2022)</h3>
							<p>Yolov3 is a popular object detection algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to identify
                                 and classify objects in images. One of the main challenges with Yolov3 is its computational complexity,
                                  which makes it difficult to deploy on low-powered devices. To address this issue, we propose to improve
                                   the performance of Yolov3 by integrating it with Mobilenet, a lightweight convolutional neural network
                                    architecture designed for mobile and embedded devices.</p>
							<p>Our project involves training a Yolov3-Mobilenet model on a large dataset of annotated images to enhance 
                                its object detection capabilities. This will involve fine-tuning the pre-trained Mobilenet model to work
                                 in conjunction with the Yolov3 algorithm, allowing us to achieve higher accuracy and faster processing times.</p>
                            <p>To evaluate the performance of our model, we will compare it with the original Yolov3 and other state-of-the-art
                                 object detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets. We will also conduct experiments to assess the model's
                                  computational efficiency and its ability to operate in real-time on resource-constrained devices.</p>
                            <p>The ultimate goal of this project is to produce a more accurate and efficient object detection algorithm 
                                that can be used in a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, security systems, and image and video analysis.</p>
